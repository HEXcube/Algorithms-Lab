    "A number of people are available to do a particular job. Each person has an initial rating from $0$ to $5$ associated with him/her. At each time step, the person with the highest rating is hired for the job. The job always lasts exactly one time-step. At the end of the job, the hired person is freed and his/her performance is rated by the employer. The new rating would be the average of all the ratings he/she has receieved so far (including the initial rating). For example, suppose Bob is the only person in the pool and suppose his initial rating is 4. Being the only person, he will be hired when required. If he then gets a rating of $3$, his effective rating would become $(4+3)/2$. After another hiring episode, if he gets a rating of $3.5$, his effective rating would be $(4+3+3.5)/3$ at the end of the job.\n",
